Majnu - 6 stars - Lust. Revenge. Decent acting. Jaideep is good, Fatima still amateurish


Khilauna - 4 stars - Nusrat as maid did not suit at all. Abhishek n the little girl were much better. Storyline above average


Geeli Puchhi - 8 stars - Hats off to Konkona. So many parameters covered in single story, Caste, Privacy, Loyalty, LGBT


Ankahee - 9 stars - The best of this. Shefali n Manav, uff what actors. Straight from the heart.






###


Starting with Majnu: It depicts the constraints of an otherwise powerful man in loving his wife, even in killing her but then he finds a friend in whom he confides but story serves a superb twist just then.


Khilauna: A clever house-help who is just trying to make a happy life for herself and her young sister, but the young girl is too smart for her age. The young girl's work deserves a special mention, she seemed like a mature actor.


Geeli puchchi: A simple married woman, who is trying to understand herself and her sexuality befriends a gay girl and how their story unfolds in an unconventional manner is worth watching.


Ankahi: Manav Kaul is extremely cute in this otherwise regular story.


Overall, the movie is a must watch. Because of the length of each story it keeps you entertained every minute you watch.


###


1. Majnu The weakest film of the anthology. Jaideep Ahlawat, who was phenomenal in 'Paatal Lok' is just not convincing enough in this, especially towards the end after the twist in the tale is revealed to the audience. This story is too thin and lukewarm to leave any kind of impact on the viewer.


2. Khilauna The movie showcases the existing difference between people from different sections of society, a concept explored by the first film 'Majnu' as well, but this one does it better. Nushrat Bharucha once again puts forth a confident acting performance. The way she has been presented may raise questions, but her acting is pretty decent. Abhishek Bannerjee, for some reason doesn't have a lot to do in the film, which is a shame considering the kind of talent that he is. The youngest member of the star cast is the most impressive as far as acting performance goes. Inayat Verma has once again proved that she is a talent to watch out for. The twist in the end is not only too dark and disturbing but also comes out of nowhere. Adding a shocking twist in the end, sometimes feels like lazy writing. A good story shouldn't really put the entire onus on its climax to leave an impact on the audience. Also, nothing builds up to what we see in the climax of the film.


3. Geeli Pucchi Easily the best film of this anthology. 'Geeli Pucchi' should have been released as a standalone because the other three stories are nowhere close to what this film is. As soon as you start watching it, you realize that you are watching something really good. This is the longest of the four films, and I am really glad they didn't force the director to reduce the length. Writer, director Neeraj Ghaywan has once again proved that he is a man of extraordinary talent. In 47 minutes, the director managed to talk about so many evils of our society, cast system, Homophobia, gender discrimination, hypocrisy, patriarchy and that too very smoothly, at no point did it feel like he was forcing something down our throat. Homosexuality is a topic, that was initially made fun of by our films, but over the years filmmakers have been trying to handle the issue with more sensitivity, and this film goes one step ahead and presents it in the most normalized manner. The protagonist, Bharti Mandal gets constantly humiliated and abused by everyone around her and at a certain point I was worried that the story might just end because Bharti had hit a new low in her life, but she decides to fight back and makes a remarkable comeback from there. The writing in 'Geeli Pucchi' is just beautiful. Leading from the front in this brilliant film are two phenomenal actresses, Konkona Sen Sharma and Aditi Rao Hydari. Once again, one of the best things about these anthologies is that it's giving opportunities to actors and actresses who are genuinely talented, but are not popular enough for producers to run after them with a bagful of cash. I loved every bit of this film. This movie is a must watch.


4. Ankahi There is a lot of noise in the film when it begins, and then it almost goes into silent mode. Almost all the dialogues in the film are said through sign language, but you won't be bored watching it. All the scenes involving Manav Kaul and Shefali Shah are as sweet and smooth as the Prateek Kuhad song that plays in the background of the film. It's all good till it ends. I didn't really understand the reason as to why it ended like that. It's a simple film, not at par with 'Geeli Pucchi' but way better than the first two films of the anthology. People should watch it for Manav Kaul and Shefali Shah, two insanely talented but highly underrated actors.


###


Watch for the acting and Geeli pucchi
Majnu: bad movie . Full of abuses and mediocre acting by the talented cast. It is a bit of an extension of sahib biwi aur ghulam.


Khilauna: This is a good movie with very good acting from the star cast. It's funny emotional scary at times and the end opens up many questions that are not answered in the script.


Geeli puchi: this is the best of all the 4 movies with amazing acting from Konkana sen. The movie though revolves around casteism, same sex interest and color obsession which some people may don't like as it is shown too much now a days when the things are changing esp when due to reservation the promotion for the particular section is better than the unreserved candidates .Nevertheless, there are still many cases around all the topics shown in the film so it deserves to be shown and it is shown very nicely in the film. Apart from this, there is a human emotional layer added to the story which makes the movie worth watching a number of times.


Ankahi: this movie is a beautiful tale and beautiful acting by the lead casts but for me it is a one time watch.

Ajeeb Daastaans, On Netflix: Neeraj Ghaywan's Short Is the Clear Winner In This Patchy Four-Film Collection
Spoiler
Geeli Pucchi means wet kiss. The term signifies the tenuous connection that two women in a small town in North India make with each other. Bharti Mandal, played by a terrific Konkona Sensharma, is the sole woman working on a factory floor. She's smart, ambitious, tough. When a co-worker insults her, she retaliates. But not with a slap. Bharti punches him in the face, like a boxer in a ring. We are told that she gets into fights every two or three months. We are also told that the factory has no toilets for women. But Bharti doesn't complain - either about that or her toxic co-worker. Her rage simmers just beneath the surface. Bharti is female, Dalit and gay. Which means she is marginalized three times over. Her talent and ability alone will never be enough to get her ahead.




###


Latter half is really good!
Watch it for the 3rd and 4th parts. The performances and screenplays would keep you engaged right through.


###


Among the 4 stories, I find the third story interesting and thought provocative. I found the first story over the top. Did not need this kind of turn and twist in this stupid way. Could have showcased the whole story in a more sensitive and constructive manner. In second story, Nusrat did not fit for the part. But the concept is good. For someone who is marginalized, how everyday goes, just to fight for their simple basic rights. How tormented their everyday life gets. And the last story seems cliché. Watched this kind of story in a different setup. However, the concept is same.


###




If you are one of those masala type Bollywood movie fans who loves watching 50 year old men dancing with arm candies half their age then this movie is not for you. Also if u think every movie is trynna push a propaganda Bcz they are not repeating the same plot from 90's and are showing actual problems ppl are facing today then again this movie isn't for u.


So for the review Il have to be honest I didn't really enjoy the first two stories. The first one was trying to do too much in a very short span of time and it came off incoherent. Also in comparison to the other stories the acting was mediocre specially the actress she was annoying.


The second story tried really hard with the WTF ending, which I already sort of guessed after a few minutes of the police station scene that the little girl had something to do with it. The story made it obvious and thus the suspense was lacking.


I love konkona and not to be biased but I liked the third one the most. I watched other similar anthology movies and this story seemed to be different. It was realistic and brought the struggles of a woman who is a minority within a minority. The chemistry between the two women was so good.


But I have to say that shefali stole the show with her acting. Was she a flawed character? Yes. She portrayed that effortlessly. The 4th story definitely tugged at my heart strings. It was sweet and emotional. Was rooting for a happy ending but I wasn't disappointed cz it made me cry.


Anyway if u like off bit movie then give it a watch!


###


Maybe the best anthology movie of India after Masaan
Watch the movie for 3rd and 4th story. They are absolutely marvelous.


Konkana and aditi rao are very good in 3rd story. It was more like a commentary on friendship.


4th story broke my heart so badly , the ending, manav kaul , first in Nailpolish and now this, he has won my heart.


Please watch this story, it is straight from the heart.


###


Waste of time
Tired of watching these short stories with the same stories everytime, extra marital affairs, same sex attraction blah blah blah. Please creators, get something new and if you get please dont visit Dharma productions. Even if the script does not have any of the above content, they might try and fit it in.


###


4 different types of film making
First movie is about a lover. Typically twists and lust stories and eventually comes down to revenge and tragic ending.


Second story is about class system, power and revenge. Nusrat plays grey character who you will not find perfect, she does the decent acting playing house helper, not the best. Specially when Tillotama Shome's is still fresh in audiences' mind in 'Sir'.


Third movie is hands down the best plot, best movie of this anthology, a LGBT story made correct. It talks about class, patriarch, cast system, equality and much more serious topics of society. Not a love story but the story about acceptance. Loved it. Greatly made.


Konkana Sen Sharma proves again why she is one of the best actor we have.


Fourth film is second best in this anthology, Shefali Shah is another gem of film industry, Manav kaul has done fabulous job. Again note that this is not a love story but the story which teaches acceptance. So the climax is set very wise and heart pinching.


###


A mixed bag in all aspects
Ajeeb Daastaans is an anthology of 4 short stories about bonding, emotions and experiences.


It starts with "Majnu", a story about Babloo, Lipakshi and Raj, involved in a 3-way love affair that had to end in bitterness no doubt. Babloo is married to Lipakshi and soon afterwards declares that he loves someone else and won't be able to love her. Lipakshi in turn starts looking for love and sexual fulfilment with other men, culminating in one Raj with whom, she feels true love. Raj is Babloo's driver's sin, who has accepted an offer from Babloo to work as his investment advisor. But Raj actually has other designs and motives, he siphones a large sum of money from Babloo's investment portfolio, travels abroad with his parents whilst leaving a message of revenge for Babloo and having asked Lipakshi to wait for him at a train station to elope. Babloo and Lipakshi face off at the venue and mull over the love and hatred they share for Raj, and the future they have now.


"Khilauna" is actually a shocker and left me not feeling good at all. Meenal is a housemaid with a certain contempt for the rich. She lives with her little sister Binny in an accommodation whose electricity supply has been snapped. She changes her job to work for another household where the lady is pregnant and the husband, an influential person, has the ability to restore Meenal's electricity. A few months pass by and the household has thrown a party to celebrate the arrival of their baby and Meenal and Binny are also present. Suddenly the electricity snapped and the baby goes missing, only to be discovered being pressure cooked to death. A police investigation ensues to nab the culprit with a macabre and twisted outcome.


"Geeli Pucchi" is about Bharti Mandal and Priya Sharma at an industrial outfit. Priya enjoys a superior position tithe workplace and confides in Bharti about her inability to conceive and also her bisexuality. Bharti was initially apprehensive about Priya but eventually develops feelings for her. At Priya's birthday celebration at her workplace, Bharti feels discriminated against for her belonging to a lower caste and Priya doesn't help the situation. Priya also uses Bharti's house to conceive her baby with her husband as their own house has no privacy. In Priya's absence from the workplace, Bharti establishes herself firmly as Priya's successor and also advises Priya's mother in law against the latter's returning work soon as she needs to care for the baby. Bharti wins the position at the factory as even the boss is now convinced that Priya won't return soon and Bharti does the job well.


The final one is "Ankahi", perhaps the best of the lot. Natasha is married to Rohan and their daughter Samaira has a condition where she is going deaf gradually. Rohan has no time to spend with the family and keeps busy at work, leaving the mother and daughter to bond with each other. Natasha meets Kabir, a hearing and speech disabled photographer at an art gallery. As Natasha moves away from Rohan due to his lack of involvement, she develops a bond with Kabir. Kabir loves Natasha but isn't aware about her family, and hesitates to declare his love for her. When he does decide to propose to Natasha, he follows her back to her home, and is shocked to find her with her daughter and husband. It is also a moment reconciliation for Natasha as Rohan has realised his fault and is now caring towards Samaira. As Kabir appears at her doorstep, Natasha has to decide if she will walk out with him into a world of love or close the door on him and return to her responsibilities.


Manav Kaul, Shefali Shah and Konkona Sen Sharma are outstanding in their respective roles and elevate Ajeeb Daastaans to a respectable level. Fatima Sana Shaikh, Jaideep Ahlawat and Abhishek Banerjee are impressive too. At direction, Neeraj Ghaywan and Kayoze Irani are superlative. The musical score is fantastic! Ajeeb Daastaans is a mixed bag - you may exercise your choice depending on what you would feel comfortable with.


###


Tales of the Selfish
Sexual orientation/identity, class divide/casteism and adultery have been the consistent themes in all the notable anthologies with A-Listers involved in the making since "Bombay Talkies", and that's quite an odd choice to make given the vast library of untouched ideas out there (films like "Shorts (2013)" and "Unpaused (2020)" are worth mentioning here). "Ajeeb Daastaans" (what's in a name?) follows the same tradition but the content varies in appeal, selfishness being the only thread that binds the four tales together. Well, that and the fact that they all have plot twists.


Where Shashank Khaitan's 'Majnu' feels like something inspired by Alt Balaji shows and happens to be a blatant waste of Jaideep Ahlawat, Raj Mehta's 'Khilauna' manages believable performances by the leads but builds to an incoherent, torturous climax.


The much talked about and critically acclaimed 'Geeli Pucchi' directed by Neeraj Ghaywan clearly deserves all the praise as it works on every level. Konkona Sen Sharma shines bright as always. Aditi Rao Hydari too embodies her role to a T. The story touches all three aforementioned themes, and delivers. The ending is bound to strike a chord with its viewers.


Kayoze Irani's 'Ankahi' left me with mixed feelings, for the performances do resonate with the viewer but the story doesn't really make its mark.


I really love anthologies and would like to see more creative ideas and actors put on screen.


###


An Anthology of Deceit
It is all about lies. Everyone is either lying to themselves or the other person. This is the theme of this anthology. Brilliant performances by Konkona Sen Sharma, Shefali Shah and Manav Kaul. Fatima Sana Shaikh fits the bill as a femme fatale and Nusrattt Barucha looks too beautiful to be a domestic helper living in shabbles but her sex appeal is fabolous. The story that takes the cake for me is the last one. It is beautiful and summarizes the whole anthology.


###


Four short stories, each narrating a bit different kind of love. In the first one Jaideep Ahlawat is completely wasted. The story is too weak. The second one is the worst, more like crime petrol drama. Poor casting (except Abhishek Banerjee) and terrible storyline. I was thinking to stop watching but last two stories are worth watching. The storyline, casting and performance all are simply fantastic. I must mention the excellent performance by Konkana Sen Sarma, Shefali Shah and Manav Kaul.


###


1st and 3rd story was good actingwise and storywise but 2nd story is pathetic and heartbreaking, 4th story is okayish nothing new!!!


###


Way better than the usual Dharma kitsch
I was pleasantly surprised, liked all 4 stories. Konkona's superlative performance blew me away - wow!! Definitely worth watching - especially the 3rd and 4th stories.


###


All my stars for the last 2 shorts, & maybe for the 2nd one as well
Last 2 shorts are class apart. Strong storyline & execution. Brilliant acting.


The 2nd one is does not hold too much impact but still deserves some appreciation.


The first one is useless. Just crap. Really bad idea to start with it. I almost turned it off thinking another typical Bombay Begum material, meaningless crap.. I'm glad I didn't.


###


Ankahi" is the most watchable out of all the four short stories. Shefali Shah and Manav Kaul have both nailed their art beautifully. Sensitive and often heart breaking portrayal. The other three are absolutely skippable. Don't know how there's such a shortage of good stories. Neither the stories are captivating nor the acting. I would say Konkona Sen Sharma is better than all the others in the three remaining stories.


###


2 BAD And 2 very GOOD Segments.
1st Story : Bad execution and screenplay. Last twist somehow saved the story. Worst out of 4.


2nd : Predictable story. Very bad acting from Nushrat and Abhishek Banerjee wasted. Inayat Verma was the only good thing.


3rd : Best not only out of 4 segments but among the recent released anthologies. Brilliant Screenplay & Direction by Neeraj and Great acting by Konkona. MUST WATCH.


4th : Beautiful story with a sad climax and lovely acting by 2 leads.


Available on Netflix.


###


Beautiful.
Ajeeb Daastaans (Hindi Anthology, 2021).


Meaty and Neatly done.


From Lust to Ghost Stories, Unpaused to Ludo. And now the Ajeeb Dastans.. Anthologies are back in trends just like the Don't Rush, Instagram Reels but unlike reels Anthologies aren't cringe infact loaded with taste which fills up your story/content appetite rather than gas filling.


Dastans has a bit of Abbas Mastans Haha.. No really it does have amusing ends watch out.


The first two stories are twisty like every anthology, with our own wild tales or wild women tales. The following two stories give the anthology a golden glow obviously by the facials from writers and directors.


Shashank Khaitan, Raj Mehta, Neeraj Ghaywan and Kayoze Irani direct these potent stories of love, lust, thrill and shock flavoured with casteism, poverty, greed and monotony.


The Thumbs Up steal the thunder wali anthology is Neeraj Ghaywan's Geeli Pucchi all others were absolutely brilliant too but Geeli Pucchi or the Sloppy Kiss as they call it is a absolute kiss on the forehead of viewers. And you that a forehead kiss is a way way special than other places.


Bharti Mandal played by Konkona Sen Sharma is till dates amusing performance and unlike last seen her on Netflix as a simple, sushil and lustful bahu here she's a tough, machine operator with a B. Com and the only thing continuing from previous characters is the lustful role. Aditi Rao Hydri is also a soft and confused women but makes a story interesting.


This anthology is like a perfect pastry puff right out from the oven with layers and layers of fat and filling. Some layers and flavours unfold, some don't. Some might like a spicy puff or a Patty as they call it in North India, some might like a mayo puff, some jeera then some just plain puff.


All these 4 anthologies are puffs only. Just different ones.


To mention the little girl Inayat Verma with Nusrat Bharucha is a absolute stunner with her acting skills and cuteness.


Starring : Fatima Sana Shaikh - beautiful.


Jaideep Ahlawat - usual.


Armaan Ralhan - nice.


Nushrat Bharucha - totally breaking some ceilings.


Abhishek Banerjee - Usual.


Konkona Sen Sharma - Masterclass performance and looks.


Aditi Rao Hydari - Usual but beautiful and chulbuli.


Shefali Shah - Awesome as always.


Manav Kaul - Mindblown.. Soothing.


Tota Roy Chowdhury - Really good.


Dharmatic Entertainment by Karan Johar is the producer.


Huge shout-out to casting and costume department too.


Unlike the privileged ones or Bollywood circuits we had to watch this Anthology on our personal screens rather than a special premiere before the release amidst the pandemic. Quite cool no. 😉


This is the type of content many on OTT want to see and such Anthologies give freedom to writers and directors to be free and not drag Saas Bahu soaps also keep the length and budget short. Making it a win win situation for all. In the age of attention deficiency who has time for a nonsensical sequence may be love or fight. Oh wait may be both are same.


It has a run time of 2.22 considering that it should be released in 2022. nevertheless it's a great and compelling watch.


Available on Netflix. Jo Youtube ke sare content creators ko khareed ke unke sath unnatural collabs karta hai aur views Kamata hai.. 😜


###


4th one ruined it
I simply don't understand why Netflix is obsessed with woke culture, justifying the cheating in marriage, is nothing but the murder of your partner's feelings.


Without 4th short, it's a clean 9.


From acting to direction and screenplay everything is now top notch in first 3 short films, I simply could've gone for 7 or 8 but I hated 4th one from core.


###


A film that sits in heart your for different reasons
Run time 2 hours and 22 mins and has compilation of four stories that sits your heart for different reasons. Personally I found only two stories that have made me engaged to my TV.


One is a fable that is related with konkona Sen Sharma and the other is related to Nusrat Bharucha. Rest of the actors has done justice to their roles but I feel these two actors have surpassed everyone and fitted into their tales seamlessly.


###


Netflix going down the drain slowly but surely
Netflix started with some awesome independent movies but now quality of scripts and direction is just getting worse and worse.


###


I very rarely write reviews.. but for this I had to!
Spoiler
What an amazing set of short stories! They actually are hard hitting issues that people like you and I experience! But to focus on what is happening in india is the true gem! From a loveless marriage to a gay aristocrat, to a love story of mother of a deaf daughter and her star crossed deaf lover! Wow! Defo worth a watch!


###


The third one is ultimate and must watch. First and third episodes are OK Second is not my cup of tea The third one is ultimate and must watch. By the end, really good making and only one story is outstanding


###


Four short realistic stories.


1-Okay.


2-Good 3-Okay 4-Good and unique.


Acting mediocore,but satisfactory.


Not a waste of time,you will enjoy I guess.


Good matinee show.


###


First story: okay. Has few gruesome scenes. Same old setting of most hindi ott films/web series. But the ending is cool


Second story: unjustified but the horrific ending gives chill. Worth a watch definitely


Third story: very different and such superb acting by the two actresses especially konkona sen sharma. Again, the ending although predictable, was a really good one


Fourth story: ankahi - this one does not have twist elements like the other three. But this is heart warming. The simple drama with great acting, heart touching script makes spending the whole 2 hrs worth it. Loved it so much. 10/10.


###


Ajeeb stories!
Majnu was average,though Jaideep left his impression brilliantly. Khilauna was below average and quite disturbing. Geeli puchi's content was strong and omg! Konkona is a beast,totally nailed her character. Ankahee,well the name is enough and Maanav Kaul stole the whole show. Stay away from the one stars and negative comments.


###


Only "Geeli pucchi" is brilliant
The overall rating is low, because of the weak plots of the other three films except "Geeli pucchi", which stands out with terrific perfomances of the actors and an amazing plot. I refer to an interview with the director of the movie, in which he explains the idea behind the film and deepens the understanding of it. I would only recommend to watch the third part of this anthology.


###


Total crap
Karan Johar has lost it! It is disgusting and to believe that social themes should be portrayed in such a gross manner is the only way or unique..


###


Amazing movie
Those who are giving one star rating to this film are pathetic stupid and illiterate people. They haven't moved on from SSR incident.


Yes it's a Karan Johar movie and a nice movie no need to defame such films.


All the actors done a really good performance specially Nusrat Konkana Aditi and Manav.


Toy story is still little dark yet a nice movie.


###


Has covid affected our standards ?
To be honest, bollywood has been producing so many useless movies with zero creativity or good scripts, its a complete joke how we still pay & keep this charade. If these movies could be rated 10, why aren't they getting oscars? Most Indian audience now watches hollywood or korean or even latin cinema rather bollywood. Much better movies down south as well.


This movie is another piece of unwarranted trash, add it to the piles of thousands already, its like ghazipur, mountain of puke worthy trash.


###




Anthologies
Every time Karan comes with new anthologies probably he wants to create a new kind of cinema where different stories are portrayed


The stories have nothing new to deliver all we had seen before like poverty disgrace racism but it's made in a very good way and all the stars have played their roles perfectly


This may also called horny daastaans as all stories has horny turnings but it's been directed in decent content


All the stories are made according to the ott platform and the casting was made to fit properly to the respective characters


Armaan played a stylish character and carried away then was nushrat she was seen in a new look which she played unexpectedly well konkana made a mark by playing a Dalit role last but not the least and the best of all was manav he will touch your emotions in the way he has acted


The ratings are only for the performances and the directions rest everything was normal


It's a 50/50 choice some may not like it also.


###


4th one the best of them all!
All the first 3 were waste of time. But the 4th one, the best and so touching. All credit to Manav Kaul. He was great!


Rated 10 only for this story.


###


Twisted and Bizarre story of Love, deceit and revenge
Ajeeb Daastans consists of four anthologies, belonging to four different ideologies of filmmaking. All are very unique and bizarre in their own ways. Some of them were beautifully bizarre while some were staright out uncomfortable. Still there was an evident over arching theme connecting these four shorts -- which is a key for an anthology cinema.


Coming to the difference in ideologies, Khaitan's story was Bollywood in its core, if not the quintessential one (which we all are so used to), but surely the character's entry with a blowing fan and unnecessarily beautifully lit scenes and dolled up actors, is surely reminiscent of contemporary Bollywood.


Raj Mehta's Khilauna belongs to yet another breed of cinema telling, which is blooming, by virtue of the OTT space. Off-beat, bold and often discomforting. This borders on infamy and immorality. Surely the jury will be divided on such films.


The later two shorts are cinema at best. These are the ones which we call the evergreen ones. These stories had worked during the golden age, they had worked time and again in different geographies with different languages and will always work in future, irrespective of the setting, cultures and even gender. Internal conflict, love and dignity drives very basic human emotions and they will always be relatable.


Talking about this film in particular. Out of the four drives of cinema making, Geeli Pucchi is the best. It is bizarre (following the central theme) yet in a human way. Neeraj Ghaywan is a master of telling convoluted stories in a constrained time and he has not disappointed this time also.


Kayoze Irani's Ankahi is a beautiful tale but doesn't fit on the over arching template of "Ajeeb". It divulges from the central theme. If seen in isolation it is perhaps one good film, but is not special.


And lastly Majnu and Khilauna are not my personal favorites. They do tell a bizarre story, but without proper structure, emotional depth the stories doesn't work for me. Khaitan's direction is confused and incoherent, filled with plot twists (almost of Abbas-Mastan's callibre). Khilauna is a take on the class divide but unfortunately with its shoddy screenplay, it seems like the social dynamic is placed just for earning "woke" brownie points and doesn't contribute much in terms of the story which is being told.


Overall Ajeeb Daastans is a story of both hits and misses, filled with both brilliant and ugly cinematic moments.


###




Bdw 2nd story is not a farce
I am from Arunachal and many many years ago a female servant boiled the baby in a pressure cooker and ran away. She did that in anger because the husband and wife used to beat her I guess. That's what I heard while growing up.


Bdw that Konkona sen and Aditi Roa story was too good. It was more than just a same sex attraction movie.


###


Cliche Dastaans
Overall it's okay. One time watch perhaps.


First part is clumsy with cliches and all that. I don't want to spoil the story but putting LBGT everywhere is not normalizing it. The story manages to ridicule the LGBT and related complications while trying to "just portraying" it. Like other three stories, the setting and plot of the story is not what you might witness in your 70 yrs life. The story must be based on reality, reflecting reality. Not creating another reality.


Second is against an old story with a Maupassant like ending but the ending is not convincing at all.


Third is clumsy again with cliches.


Forth one is beautiful and interesting to me. But yet again boring.


###


About 5 minutes of scenes are watchable
That's it. The rest is just utter nonsense like fillers. Boring. Dont bother.


###


Surprisingly Good!
Here are the stories from the best to the wort


1) Ankahi - Undoubtedly the best of the bunch. Don't misunderstood me, the story is not at all good in this one, but it manages to have a constant smile on my face during he interactions between Manav Kaul and Shaifali Vaidya. 9/10


2) Geeli Pucchi - Hands down the best acting has been done in this one. Konkana Sen Sharma is a gem, eho been criminally underutilised in bollowood. Aditi Rao Haidri hit the perfect notes as well. Top notch commentry on various topics like caste discrimination, LGBTQ unawareness, different classes of workers in a factory. Solid 8.5/10


3) Khilauna/ Majnu - both these stories rely purely on shock factor which while works to some extent but also makes the viewer unsatisfied due to absolutely no foreshadowing. 6.5/10.


###


Only last 2 are worth watching.
1st one is typical KJo sh** - rated 2 2nd one gets a little better than KJo sh*" - rated 5 3rd - Too good for KJo to produce it - rated 9/10 4th - Pretty good - rated 8.


###


Isko laga dala toh khud toh pakaa daala
I know we are waiting for good content, pandemic has really put us in desperation. But almost 99.9% this industry fails to live up to even bearable one time watch quality.


If this is entertaining, people might as well start watching those gaming streams from noobs. Better content. And thats a depressing fact.


Ajeeb is actually appropriate for this movie.


###


Superior to other hindi Anthologies on Netflix.
The 2nd and 3rd episodes were amazing. the final episode was also quite good though the first episode was quite lackluster.

# One By One #
Majnu - Story revolving around marriage and sexuality of character..fatima not fit as a character..Majnu character arc is uncertain overall ending is good enjoyable in some portions Khilauna - Film revolving around poor and rich society with some tragedy..on paper film look good but actingwise nothing new except child actress..ending is shocking without proper buildup but presentation is unsatisfactory Geeli Pucchi - Film revolving around cast system..I don't want to share any spoilers regarding the story but it is exceptional performancewise and arcwise..story isn't key for the film but presentation good Unkahee - Film revolving around family..this film is exceptional at performance and no spoilers man! It is treat to watch!

We all have watched similar movies like this one. Yet it doesn't disappoint you. Don't get fooled by these Dharma Production's haters. They are blindly giving negative ratings here. Not bad at all.

Honestly, i loved the first 2 stories majnu n khilauna. But, the 3 n 4 stories doesn't make me feel one. Its like 3rd n 4th are incomplete. All over great daastaans. Great cast performance from everybody. Netflix getting better.

Only half good, only half strange
This sort of narrative is quite to my liking, because it tells short, concise stories and doesn't engage viewers in long developments. In so doing, it allows for an easy watch. Does the movie itself live up to the benefit of such a narrative? Not necessarily. First, the film's name translates as "Strange Stories". Ironically, the first two stories are strange but not good, the latter two are better but not strange at all. But let's go straight to the business:


The first episode: Majnu


A nice conclusion is all this episode has going for it. Otherwise, it's a rather poor show with some ridiculous twists which are unintentionally funny if not laughable. Fatima Sana Shaikh plays a role which requires someone with tremendous sex appeal. Maybe Nushrat Bharucha who acts in the next episode would have been a greater choice for this film. Overall it's a watchable tale of revenge, but it has all the possible cliches that we've seen before, as manifest in the roles of Jaideep Ahlawat and Armaan Ralhan.


The second episode: Khilauna


A watchable but poorly concluded episode which is not particularly convincing and above all quite cliché. Nushrat Bharucha is quite attractive, but she doesn't seem to have the right sensibilities to play this lower middle-class worker and is presented as overly sophisticated. She is still good carrying the film on her shoulders. The little girl is cute, but the conclusion is just not convincing enough and feels very derivative.


The third episode: Geeli Pucchi


Let's start with what matters most: Konkona Sen Sharma is the main attraction of this episode. She is nothing short of stupendous playing the tough feisty woman, which is rarely represented in Hindi films, and not for a second does she ever overdo it, not the masculine traits, not the tone, not the lack of confidence and not the emotions. Everything is incredibly measured and real. Does the episode live up to the heights of her performance? Sadly, not much. It does address themes of caste, sexuality, class, gender issues and so on, but something is missing, the overall feel is too grim, and the story does not fully captivate. It could be the slow development (despite being a short episode after all) or the weaker performance of Aditi Rao Hydarim, but having said all that, it is very rewarding, and way to go Konkona.


The fourth episode: Ankahi


The best episode in the film, beautifully filmed, thought out and performed. Shefali Shah is one of the finest actors I can imagine - real, intense, amazingly expressive yet brilliantly balanced, with extraordinary range and understanding of the human condition. Her portrayal of Natasha is beautifully nuanced and credible. And more than anything, she is given a fantastic coactor in Manav Kaul, who is tremendous and greatly likable as her deaf friend-cum-lover. He is consistently in sync with his character. These two form a great pair and their romance is portrayed beautifully. Natasha's struggle at home is also handled well, especially her relationship with her daughter. Ankahi concludes on a rather sad, ironic note, but it is rewarding enough and was definitely worth the wait.


Ajeeb Daastaans is a collection of short films which have nothing in common and which fluctuate considerably in their quality. Above all, most of them have nothing weird about them so the film doesn't even live up to its name (if you want to see a film that remains true to its premise, watch Damián Szifron's 2014 Argentine masterwork Wild Tales (2014)). The latter two episodes are the best, especially the final one, but as a whole, the entire thing is not very good.

Interesting
A Hindu drama It tells 4 different stories where there is an intruder, they are not necessarily love stories, but something that you want to achieve and someone does not allow it.


The endings are realistic.


Quality.


The second story may feel a bit lazy compared to the rest.


With good twists, most are unpredictable, editing helps a lot because it manages to confuse you in some.


With LGBTQ moments.


The script is smart and slightly sly.


Show a bit of Hindu culture.


The performances are good.


Stories that don't tie together like wild tales, like sorry stories did even though I would think they were going to tie together at some point.


He talks about love, being oneself, about revenge, about the abuse of the most powerful to the poorest or weakest, about the empathy we feel for others, about the family and the support in it and also how to remove someone from in the middle.


Quite an interesting proposal.

Ajeeb Dastaans
1st Story (Majnu)-Quite a nice one,good acting with good twist but it seem to be very simple ! 5/10 2nd Story (Khilauna)-Nusrat acting was on top as well as Banerjee's but the story left incompleted ! 3/10 3rd Story (Geeli Puchi)-First i have seen aditi'acting and she was perfect in her role along with konkona no words the story was amazing showing the reality not only with the same love but the patriarchy,the caste,gender neutral ! Splendid ! 8/10 4th Story (Unkahin)-This one is so beautiful,from story to acting everyone! Totally Loved this one ! 7/10


And now above all,my personal favorite were two the 3rd (Geelipuchi) and the 4th one (Unkahin)

Ajeeb and touching tales!
It is a set of Ajeeb Daastans, well worth your time, at least for the genuine, galvanising Geeli Pucchi, adorable yet affecting Ankahi and the kooky Khilauna, if not for the mediocre, meretricious Majnu throwing light on a few relevant issues, by way of some touching tales.


Ajeeb yet touching tales!


. Geeli Pucchi comes first and stands out from the rest. There is not a single relevant social issue that has not been touched upon, be it the woes of casteism/sexism at a workplace or the ills of patriarchy. With an elegant portrayal coupled with some laudable body language adjustments, Konkona Sen Sharma's Bharti Mandal becomes unforgettable.


Ankahi finishes in the second spot. With lovely dialogues, warm presentation and delightful Manav Kaul-Shefali Shah chemistry, we are treated to a cute watch, whilst leaving an impact.


Khilauna, which finishes third, features one of the creepiest endings, the build-up to which is gripping. It is a glaring and chilling take on the existing class differences prevalent in our society, the dodgy tactics that the less privileged are forced to employ to lead a better life and the heart-wrenching repercussions that transpire as a consequence of their actions.


Majnu, which finds itself way behind, is one of the flicks that should not have been part of the other three gems. Majnu is too showy, be it the dialogues or the presentation, yet with no substantial content or takeaways.


I am surprised why they started with Majnu. Wouldn't there be quite a few unlucky lot, who decide not to watch further and stop at Majnu?

Wasted potential
I think the subjects they touched required a deeper introspection than what the movie offers. The stories just scratch the surface but leave a lot unsaid to the viewers imagination. Content justifying extra marital affairs for women have become a norm these days. Problem is the way it is portrayed, which gives a message it is 'OK' and not a big deal. While following your heart is a theme worthy to explore, it needs to be presented properly ( like in Kabhi Alvida) and here I think it was handled poorly, especially in the last story.

Love the way these characters and stories are not the usual boring Black and White
Netflix is a pro at creating characters who're neither good or bad. They reside in grey areas. Flawed, selfish, but also loving, kind. The true nature of humans.


The acting is powerful! And as most people have said, Gheeli Pucchi and Ankahi are not up to be missed. Though the first two stories are well made too.


I can see why it's hard to digest for people who're used to the usual cookie cutter characters churned out by mainstream Bollywood or Hollywood.


If you get out of denial and sticking to colonial mindsets, and go back instead to our original, pre-British culture, you'll relate to these stories so much better.

Ajeeb dastaan: hai ye, Kaha shuru Kaha khatm !!
Starts with a dull note ends on a bright one!


'Majnu' : Not much twists, no character detailing .Can be skipped


Khilauna : Deals with dark subject, dwells on class divide. Songs & BGM nice


Geeli Puchi: LGBT Story ; decent watch


Ankahee: I liked this most. Touching story Nice acting & direction.


Prateek Kuhad's song is too good.


Technical aspects in all 4 films are good.


Worth a watch!!

Worth watching. Geeli Pucchi and Khilauna are great.
Worth watching. Geeli Pucchi (third story) and Khilauna (second story) are great. One is a social commentary and the other is another social commentary mixed with mystery.


Majnu (the first story) is not the best but carried by good acting by Aihlawat. The story is not the best and feels forced.


Ankahi (the last story) is great. Possibly the best acting role of the whole series is by Shefali Shah in this story.


I felt that Khilauna is sexualized for no apparent reason but the story is good overall. Finally, Geeli Pucchi, really nicely showcases the complex issues of caste, love, and worker conditions. Would loved more focus on that last part, but hey, it's a short story and definitely worth watching.

Something new to the crappy Bollywood!!
We want bollywood to make movies like Hollywood does, but then I see the reviews of this movie here and I understand that we literally deserve the kinda crap bollywood makes, because we fail miserably to appreciate movies like this.


I understand the reviews, because all the people here want some ridiculous item songs, copied story from Southern Cinema, and ultra dumb action.


This is a very good piece of cinema, divided among 4 short stories, each defining something new. Every story might appear a clichè as it begans, but trust me the ending to each story is a lot different from what one expects to happen. This movie is definitely not for the people who watch "Bhai" movies. It's for different crowd and I'm really glad bollywood made something like this.

Ajeeb reviews
Looks like people from 60s got Netflix account and made an IMDb account to leave low ratings.


Here's an honest one.


1. Majnu: This one shouldn't have existed. What a waste of Jaideep Alhawat. Fatima tries her best with what she's given but the writing was so bad it felt like ripped from some railway station novel. Predictable and without a sense of character or motivation.


2. Khilona: Nushrat Barucha does her best but she seriously needed a makeover. Baby Inayat is one of the best child artists working in industry today and Abhishek Banerjee is wasted. They try so hard to misdirect but it just doesn't work. Maybe I missed something but I don't get why this short needed to exist.


3. Geeli Pucchi: Konkona Sen Sharma is amazing but Aditi Rao Hydari surprises with her career best performance and stands shoulder to shoulder with Konkona. This story about classism and castiesm needed to be told. It's beautifully shot, background score is good and is fun to watch. Best of the bunch.


4. Ankahee: Shefali Shah plays a sign language speaking mother of a daughter who is going deaf. Wonderfully acted and starts strong but really fizzles out in the end. Though the climax was satisfying, it didn't go where I thought was the potential. But lots of people love this one and has the best background score of all.


Overall anthologies like these need to exist and to be watched. I would rate it 6 out of 10 but +2 to compensate for the bad reviews.

Ajeeb Daastaans Review: An emotional ride but not without the bumps.
There are a lot of things that I felt while watching Ajeeb Daastaans, but what remained constant through the narrative was of the feeling of despondency. Which is when a line from Kayoze Irani's segment Ankahi came to my aide. Manav Kaul plays Kabir, a photographer in the short. When Shefali Shah's Natasha tells him, "I think the photographs you click have a little sadness in them." To that Kabir responds, "What people see in my photographs, it says less about me and more about them." That's what Ajeeb Daastaans and the four filmmakers manage to do, help you relate. Directed by Shashank Khaitan, Raj Mehta, Neeraj Ghaywan and Kayoze Irani, this anthology talks about humans, our relationships, and the baggage that organically comes with it.

A total waste of time .
The movie comprises of 4 short stories . First 2 story is total waste . No new concept . 3rd story is also ok one . About the 4th story this is also repeatative concept .


The 2 star I have given for the two gem .


One star for Konkana Sen's acting another star is for Shefali mam's acting .


Otherwise the full movie is same old bollywood ghisa pita concept .


Keep a safe distance from the movie .


At the end of each chapter you will definitely be unable to figure out what the director wants to show .


That much pathetic the movie is .

This is definitely one of best movie of 2021.. Superb shorts right from the story 1. It just takes off with each story with the last story just beautiful. The characters of all the stories & specially last 2 were just brilliant. Would recommend to anyone who understands content which is above the commercial masala movies. This movie is noy for the ones who are looking conventional movie..

Netflix's yet another attempt of propoganda
This collection of anthology doesn't have any relevance with ground and is based on the woke bs these people sitting in AC rooms imagine.. they're politically motivated and are fake and malicious.


Acting is worst amongst all features of this series. Screenplay too lose and after every 3-4 mins you feel like closing the episode.


Instead of such malicious, uncreative, boring art pushing foreign malicious narrative, Netflix should invest in good foreign series which are entertaining.

A little gem
Such anthologies are the order of the day. Neatly woven, topically relevant and finely acted. The third story about the relational dynamics of an untouchable girl and a Brahmin girl uncovers the fiercely hypocritical, discriminatory, and oppressive Indian society that we support and live in. That story is one of kind and the other three also deserve adulation. Go watch.

Horrible show with ghastly visuals! - trigger warning
Spoiler
This movie is nonsense Shock value just for shock value that makes no sense to the story.


The second story khilauna needs a warning for people about to watch it. The fact that this has a 15 rating is shocking Spoiler warning.


In this story they are investigating the death of a child and they show the 1 month old child dying in a pressure cooker! And at the end it is traveled that another 8 year old child killed the baby. Doesn't make sense, mindless stomach turning visual just for the sake of it.


I hope others read this to prepare themselves if they want to watch it.

Like usual konkona here also, solid performance. On the other hand aditi rao hyadri is so amazing and once you will watch her act, you would how much she is under rated. She should be given more chance, seriously.

I wish if Netflix can show something good with Hindu people. They only show the bad things with in Hindus. Definitely Netflix is a Part of Antihundu propaganda.

Mixed bag
I was bored and wanted something different to watch. I happened to enjoy Indian movies and gave this one a try. Having to read English subtitles I found the stories were not hard to follow. I probably missed some of the subtlety and nuances of certain scenes but for the most part I understood what the directors tried to project onscreen.


#1. I must admit I laughed out loud at the fireside scene between Babloo and Raj. The actor playing Babloo could barely contain his own laughter in such a sobering scene. The actor playing Raj should get an award for keeping a deadpan stare. Outside of that scene the rest of story was weak filler leading up to that "reveal." The end was unsatisfying.


#2. I really liked the premise of the story. This had potential to be great thriller/drama movie. The time constraint of this segment forced many of the characters to be under-developed. So many crazy but important things are happening here yet the story failed to impress in its current form.


#3. Interesting forbidden love story but again hamstrung by the short time allotted to it. The acting felt amateurish which could be another consequence of the short story structure. The strongest scene was at the tea service where incredible tension is brewing underneath all the small talk.


#4. For me the weakest of the bunch. It neither made me laugh nor cry. They properly devoted the bulk of the time developing the main characters but the story fell flat. The awkward doorway standoff at the end made it clear these actors weren't very good.


In total, I gave 4 stars because you can watch it without hating yourself for wasting your time. But you know they all could have been so much better.

I have thoroughly connected with all the stories
Amazing stories, really like them. The last one was my most favourite. We all know that somewhere in our life we have been through something that neither we can really portray in words nor we can share with anyone. We scare that people in our indian society will start judging us based on what they consider is right or wrong.


Really appreciate the writers of all these stories and how they make us watch, beautifully. Thank you!

Pure garbage
The first two stories were literally garbage. The plot was pathetic. Especially the second one. It was the worst story I have ever seen on Netflix. It didn't make any sense. The last story and 3rd story were great. I liked the last one more. Overall, if you want to watch this movie, save your precious time and skip the first two stories. They aren't worth your time at all.

Watch it only for the second half
Spoiler
Story 1 . A basic story of where a man is forcefully married to a girl which is the mp's daughter and the story moves on blah blah blah I would give the story 6/10 just for the message Story 2. A story of where a maid (Nushrat Bharucha) is with her daughter who lives with her mother's employer after school soon a new person comes who is in charge of the electricity in town coincidentally the maid's house has no electricity u know where this is going right Indian men maid and sex yep rating it 6/10 also just for the ending Story 3. Bharti Mandal (Konkona) works in a factory as where people disgrace because of her caste as mandal is a Low caste surname konkona attempts to act as a bhuj a person who feels like a boy but is a girl and Is a lesbian then a new worker comes in Aditi Rao hydri and then they build a relationship with the ending being the greatest of them all Rating it 10/10 for Konkona and the ending Story 4. All I have to say is it is manav kaul's show 10/10 watch it for the story and manav kaul.

Bollywood mature
It's nice as an audience to be treated with maturity.


The 4 stories show how much we need to get away from the stupid network of the nepotism bound Bollywood families.


Each story has incredible casting and the actors young and old do justice to their roles.


The stories itself are very mature, in tune with reality of the modern India and is so much better than the rubbish spewed out in general by "so-called stars"

Don't expect originality from Dharma productions. Casting is not up to the mark! They could have done much better in the casting department. The last story starring Manav Kaul seems like a scene lifted from "Up in the Air."

Rating 9 only for the last two stories.
The starcast for all the stories is quite brilliant, however the 2 stories led by Jaideep Ahlawat and Abhisek Banerjee respectively lack the grip. The stories led by Konkana Sen and Shefali Shah are worth watching and have rated 9 just for these 2 stories.

She's having this conversation with her teenage daughter. She's just not perfect for the role.


She's now having a sign language with that man. Rohan and his wife are sitting and are having a tussle on the bed.


She has her own problems with Rohan and happiness with that guy. It's shown in the movie how the strange thing happens. I feel for Shefali. She is shown a doer in this movie but I feel somewhere her inner craft is being underutilised. Then she did've a sexual intercourse with that man. After this was in flashback she goes to her home and there she finds that Rohan & his daughter are gregarious laughing! She's shocked and amused to see that man. She started to weep. She says we don't need anything. He then reverts back with sign language that you managed to lie with your eyes. She closes her main entrance door and weeps heavily. Her daughter uses sign language to express that man loved you? She doesn't have a reply.

Similar to lust stories
It is similat to lust stories 2018. Four different stories about sex, lust, love, emotions and social impact.


Directed carefully with suitable cast. Strong messages and mind searching meanings.


Evolution in short stories presentation.


All departments done thair job perfectly so film became so meaningful.

ONLY FOR PART 3- GEELI PUCHI (SLOPPY KISSES)
First thing first- only a review for the 3rd part of the anthology, titled "Geeli Puchi" aka Sloppy kisses. Starts around 1:06 or something. Other parts seemed less interested to me, so i didn't watch.


Damn the seggsual tension between konkana & aditi is so convincing & hawt. If you're a girl who's into girls, or just even curious, you gotta watch it. It doesn't sexualize a woman being attracted to another, common in indian series & movies. Nor does it overly romanticize it that makes it corny. Perfect raw representation of gay attraction mingled w heteronormative inhibitions.


An amazing story that within minutes captures the core intricasies of caste based bigotry, hetero-normativity, marital norms, the grey area between friendship and attraction, and comprises made in an arranged marriage.


Bharti's (konkana) character shows the kind of people who aren't instinctually vengeful but can get so when pushed to the edge. She also craves love deeply. I like that she's professionally ambitious but not predatory. Does not try to get priya out of the way until she does her dirty. Infact she respects priya's inhibitions about getting close to her.


While, priya (aditi) is a typical people pleaser, who thinks they are being nice even when they're hurting people or being manipulative. I think a part of her is genuinely nice but she's kinda unevolved. Of course, she's much more than that: carefree and tries to be "open minded" but truly can't let go of their prejudices. Besides that her struggle w marriage and repulsion to her spouse perfectly show how arranged marriages in india can turn out.


Both are very well rounded characters, the plot is very nuanced in subjects it deals w. The performances are bang on. The casting was perfect they took two the of the hottest and most talented actresses.

Censorship required!!!
Spoiler
I was very keen to watch this, bcoz some of fav actors. Konkana, Shefali, Aditi, Nushrat, Abhishek, Manav. I would have rated this movie a 8 star. if not for one scene. This particular scene is disturbing to the hilt! And the inappropriate visuals thru it's conveyed to the audience.


I have been a great supporter of new age story telling. But content creators can't abuse freedom. Content has to be responsible. Everything is not cool.


Bcoz of scenes like this I UNDERSTAND WHY CENSORSHIP IS IMPORTANT.

People in india just love mediocrity.thats the only reason i can come upto looking at just 6.7 ratings.


All the stories were unique and gave a bizzare ending in a beautiful way.


All the actors did a nice job. Specially Konkana sen is a legend.infact every actor was so good i feel bad naming only one.aditi rao,shefali,manav kaul had great stories which were made even more beautiful with there acting.


9 out of 10.

Love, a Multi-faceted Thing
I've watched Hindi movies before but this anthology is pleasantly surprising because it impacts the viewer in a meaningful way. Of the 4, "Sloppy Kisses" and "Unspoken" are poignant but they are not overly dramatic. They are better than the rest. But this doesn't mean that the others are not well-crafted, too.


They get their message across, and the viewer relates with it. It's just that "Sloppy Kisses" and "Unspoken" deliver more punch. And you would have wanted an alternate ending. We'll, the viewer could imagine a different ending, one that suits his own experience and perspective of the world.


I'm not really familiar with the actors but they are good. The music is hauntingly sweet that adds to one's appreciation of the stories..And kudos to the directors who have given us a meaningful film that resonates with the viewer.

Karan johar gets 1 star always
They show their problems in their movies and expect people to believe they are normal. After Sushant tragedy, why Netflix still works with Karan Johar? Give this idiot Karan Johar 1 star. for ever.

Best stories so far!!
4 stories. Two LGBT and two other extraordinary. Konika Sen is in next level here. I love her from Wake Up Sid. Must watch once if you love watching short movies.

Recycled. Mostly.
The name put me off. Daastaans?! Are we creatively so bankrupt?


Story #1: Saheb Biwi Gangster meet Kalank outtakes meet Johar's Bombay Talkies meet Cobalt Blue? Also Mahie Gill would have been better.


Story 2: Could not watch.


Story 3: Too stretched but solid solid acting by Konkona Sen.


Story 4: Well intended but too rushed and lacked the nuance this story needed.


I missed the fractured silences someone experiences while losing her hearing - Prime's recent Sound Of Metal showed that brilliantly. Shefali Shah and Manav Kaul were lovely though and the world was fresh. The Love Actually inspired climax felt jaded. Having said that - this was the most watchable of the bouquet.

Ajeeb Dastaans
Ajeeb Dastaans is a 4 short story anthology film, but the story I loved the most was the fourth one with Shefali Shah. Konkana and Aditi Rao's story was also good, second story gave me sleepless nights, first was alright.

Just amazing!
Brilliantly done 4 stories, all of them touch you in a unique way. Performances, story, dialogues, top notch direction, everything leaves its mark on your mind. The characters are from everyday life but carry some unique traits that are not that common! Kudos to Dharmatuc productions for this gem:

Anthology of 4 Different Stories !!!
"MAJNU" - This is the best story in the complete movie. Directed by Shashank Khaitan. Set in Barabanki, the segment opens to a couple in a haveli: Babloo (Jaideep Ahlawat), a rich and shady businessman, Lipakshi (Fatima Sana Shaikh), a politician's daughter. Their marriage resembles a business alliance - benefitting their parents, arranged without the couple's consent - and Babloo tells her on the first night that he'll only fulfil the nominal duties of a husband. Majnu, even with a runtime of 31 minutes, tests your patience. Its monotonicity - induced by stagnant characters, stock scenes, stale themes - is only rivalled by its condescending gaze. Time and again, Khaitan injects humour in the piece by deriding a 'side character' - a marginalised figure, both in the story and in the society. That's not all: there's another twist, which is almost as incredible and ludicrous - held afloat by embarrassing means - reducing the short to a juvenile revenge story. Majnu is the kind of movie whose screenplay will make even the casual watcher go, "Man, at least pretend to try."


"KHILAUNA" - Directed by Raj Mehta. It revolves around a domestic help, Meenal (Nushrratt Bharuccha), and her younger pre-teen sister, Binny (Inayat Verma). They frequent the shop of a local clothes presser, Sushil (Abhishek Banerjee), which irks the residential locality's secretary, Vinod (Maneesh Verma). (Meenal is having an affair with Sushil; Vinod lusts after her.) Meenal's house has no electricity for days; someone stole her 'katiya', and only Vinod can help her. Juggling between the past and present, where cops torture Meenal and Sushil for committing a murder, Khilauna builds some intrigue. But Mehta, like many Indian short fiction directors, is fixated on a climactic twist. Khilauna, as a result, feels hollow: Its climax, trying hard to be clever and gory, is predictable. These are not strange, as much as disjointed, shorts: their ends don't recogonise the means.


"GEELI PUCCHI" - Directed by Neeraj Ghaywan. It tells the story of a factory worker, Bharti (Konkona Sen Sharma), who feels slighted that, despite an impressive undergraduate aggregate and correct answers in the interview, she didn't get the data operator job. Instead, it went to a new hire, Priya (Aditi Rao Hydari). The short considerably improves in its final stretch, where it liberates itself from the shackles of an impassioned op-ed and transforms into a piece of complex fiction, filled with subtle surprise and impressive attention to detail. It also feels politically satisfying, as Bharti, deploying 'sophisticated' savarna subterfuge, defeats her nemeses at their own game. This constant pressing of ideas - and stretching and explaining and re-explaining an evident thought - makes the material predictable. So, when Bharti comes out as a Dalit in front of Priya, you sense that she won't take it well. (She doesn't.) In a later scene, Priya is about to hug Bharti but stops.


"ANKAHI" - Directed by Kayoze Irani. Story is centred on a married couple in Mumbai, Natasha (Shefali Shah) and Rohan (Tota Roy Chowdhury), whose daughter, Samaira (Sara Arjun), has a hearing impediment. Natasha thinks Rohan doesn't spend time with her daughter; he disagrees. She has learned the sign language for Samaira; he hasn't. The need to communicate - the most basic need in a relationship - informs this short. Natasha becomes a different person when she befriends a deaf and mute photographer, Kabir (Manav Kaul). He hasn't found someone who speaks his language; she hasn't found someone who listens to her. Clocking in at 26 minutes, Ankahi is the shortest and the breeziest film of the anthology. Not a lot happens on the surface. The parents' marital discord compels Natasha to find solace in Kabir. They chat, crack jokes, and frequent different parts of the city. It's the kind of love story you may have seen numerous times. Manav Kaul's Kabir does speak with his eyes, conveying reams without saying a word. It's an assured performance that distils the thrills and expectations of new-found love - and does so through memorable specificities. It makes perfect sense: Every love story has its own language. Love is, after all, a linguistic detail.

What they are showing isn't the rampant truth and exceptions, portrayed so grossly, just disgust you and leave a very bad taste in the mouth. They're neither entertaining nor enlightening. Not one story is positive.

Justice for SSR is not here
I think justice for SSR group are still in their own world , empty brains still can't realise KJ has nothing to do with it the CBI only found few kilograms of ganja so kindly don't connect this movie with boycott KJ , he is talented with few failures no doubt but this one is good no need to pull it down. It's interesting one time watch so one should appreciate it. All stories are interesting and all actors have done a good job .

Pathetic. Not worth your time.
All of these films are one worse than the other except for the last one, Ankahee. Watch only Ankahi ft. Shefali Shah and Manav Kaul. That's the only good thing. The others are utter nonsense, not worth anyone's time.

Routine Stuff..Not bad but Not So Good also
Run o the mill short stories packed neat and with some Sexual garnishing.


Performances are good but the scripts are pretty weak and drab in their screenplays.


Not bad but nothing that u cant miss it.


Just routine short stories its liked u pick scenes from diff films over the years nd shoot episodes outta it.

Definitely worth a watch.

Contrived and forced- waste of time
The stories are fractured and poorly written, even the macabre "ajeeb" endings- I usually love horror,however bad- but these were just injected as unconnected to the story and forced for shock value. Acting is overtly hammy. Lastly, Netflix management has inserted its trademark their Hindu-hating dog whistles through the show- e.g all bad guys have the red mauli on the wrist etc- but even those bits managed to be boring LOL.

Now when the name Karan Johar appears in any title with a movie, expect some nonsense. Once again, the new found issues after legalization of laws are being openly spread through this media. All the parts are useless and not evening worth watching, however, the last line of last story Ankhai was superb.


If you havent watched, you are not missing anything.

Pathetic and most disturbing second story
Spoiler
It's very heartbreaking to see such act and encouraging other minds. This movie is not for everyone specially for parents of newborn babies rather all the parents.


Boiling a baby to death in the cooker is the most disturbed scene that I have ever witnessed .


One can't even imagine such disturbing scene These types of scenes should be banned & ignored to come up in movies.


Not recommend at all. If one is dying to see just forward the second part.

Story 2 is so disturbing, and why why would you want to add this story unless you have disclaimer or genre as physcopath killing.


Story 1 is also horrible. Waste of talent.


Story 3 - is only one bearable and watchable


Story 4 - again typical bollywood world, one night stands for women frustrated from their husbands.

Again a slap on Hinduism
On which earth anyone will keep his Dog name same to his father's name. Shocked!! Don't worry it's Bollywood.


In this movie they have intentionally named a street dog same as Lord Ram father name "Dasrath".


I feel so sad about the mentality of the director/Producer why they are doing it and why with only Hindu religion. You are the architects of the future ,If you spread these ridiculous cheap thoughts what you are going expect from next generation.

Worse than a B-grade webseries. Total propaganda.
As soon as I saw the name Karan Johar, I realised this will just be another garbage. Yet I gathered courage to watch this. The stories are awful and every part have same thing. Same sex attraction, extra marital affair etc. Maybe Karan wants to portray his awful worthless life story in the form of Netflix garbage?


Please stop shoving far left western garbage in India. This will not work. Maybe only the weed smoking alcoholics from jnu university will like this garbage.


The night scenes feel fake. In the age of such advanced cinematography, these guys still don't know how to use proper lighting. This is worse that some of those B-grade webseries.

It appears that KJ and his team have one task in hand and that is how to show affairs and melodrama which have nothing but infidelity and love making with same gender or otherwise. Their thought process stops there.

Geeli Pucchi (and Ankahi, to an extent) gets a thumbs up. The rest fall short, no pun intended! [+52%]
Majnu - Lacks conviction and feels rushed; this is the kind of (short) film that uses gay romance simply for the sake of a twist that doesn't pay off. Performances are okayish.


Khilauna - Takes the male gaze almost the entire time, even though the film's protagonist is a woman. It suffers from the same fate as the previous short, with a twist that serves more to shock than prove to be a befitting finale.


Geeli Pucchi - Undoubtedly, the winner among the quartet. Director Neeraj Ghaywan tackles homophobia, patriarchy, and casteism with incredible nuance. As we witnessed in his debut film Masaan, he lends his lead characters sufficient texture to evolve on their own, not taking sides. Konkona Sensharma and Aditi Rao Hydari are absolutely wonderful in their portrayals. The twist at the end is subtle, yet impactful as hell.


Ankahi - This short effectively utilizes sign language to evoke emotions in viewers. Much of it feels like a slice-of-life tale, with adequate performances and a twist that only comes across as inconsistent with one of the characters' shades. It's a tale well-told but a tad too obvious that it'll end in heartbreak.


Overall, Ajeeb Daastaans is a mixed bag. Geeli Pucchi is my only worthwhile pick!

While rest three stories were kind of average, the last and 4th was absolutely beautiful. Stunning acting by Manav and Shefali.
