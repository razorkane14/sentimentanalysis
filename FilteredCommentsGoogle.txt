Geeli Pucchi- Here onwards the movie starts getting better, both the lead characters are spot on, one can appreciate the brilliance of Konkana Sen Sharma as well as Aditi Rao Hydari played her part with grace. The plot was very good and the subtle use of societal differences that still exists in the world were upto the mark.
*3.5 out of 5*

Geeli Pucchi - Neeraj Ghaywan (Director): A tale of friendship between two factory worker and how they learn about each other frames the story.


Konkona Sen Sharma as rough and tough tomboy character has literally just nailed it. Even the way she has captured the mannerisms makes your believe in her talent even more. Aditi Rao Hydari as simple housewife is adorable and plays her part equally well that you can't take your eyes off her. The camaraderie between leads is sight to behold but climax is heartbreaking.

Much has been said about the Neeraj Ghaywan episode GEELI PUCHI starring Konkona and Aditi Rao Hydari. As always Neeraj deals with caste politics as it impacts present day India even today and he throws in a twist with gender based complications and love thereof! Konkona's work on this character, whether entirely directed by Neeraj or some of her own doing is brilliantly observed. From her purposeful walk, not to be confused with the more sensual gait, to her hardened look at everything around her, she projects the absolute determination of someone out to make the best of whats available to her given the circumstances. Her most tender moments are on display with the stray that she feeds and has for a pet, profusing affection as though it were her own, at once chiding and showering it with what it needs. If there was a metaphor for fulfillment of give and take without judgement, then this should be it!! It is one of the most underrated scenes of the short. The plot is strong, the performances lovely, Aditi Rao Hydari providing the delicate and easily hurt vulnerability. Another player that really puts in an outstanding performance in however short a role is the actor playing Aditi's husband. The character's endearing love for his wife, just comes through beautifully.

The pairing of porcelain beauty Aditi Rao Hydari and the no nonsense rough and tough Kankana SenSharma was fabulous mix of odds whose chasm of caste and status can never be bridged. Geeli Pucchi with a hint of lesbianism is a subtle story of revenge too when in the end Kankana replaces Aditi in job by giving her advice to be stay at home mother. I found the use of Kankana's flat for lovemaking by Aditi and her husband an allusion to 36 Chowringhee Lane, a film made by Kankana's mother Aparna Sen. Neeraj Gyaywan never fails to bring reality of caste divide in his films post Masaan.

But you know,in my personal opinion that the GEELI PUCHI was best in rest of the story.kankana's dialog, her acting was very powerfull. Only her eyes explained a lot, his anger, his pain, his failure, his jealousy.superb. The story is also great. Maybe those who are victims of the cast system can relate to it. This is shown in many stories and films but the unique thing about this story is that Kankana (as a Dalit) comes out of that situation. Very beautifully shown.in that situation her eyes was........I have no words to describe.
PIease go and watch, would definitely recommend to watching it.👏👏
Myaaao.


All the stars that I gave is for the 3rd and 4th story. The one it had Konkona Sen and Aditi Rao, was undoubtedly the best to me. Konkona just stole the show with her perfect performance and Aditi was just how one expects from her, subtle, beautiful and simple. 


Myaaao


GEELI PUCCHI: You can just imagine to watch a cast of Konkana Sen Sharma and Aditi Rao Hydari, they are so beautiful with their craft. 


Overall
Strong Acting & Casting • Good Direction & Narration • Story & Screenplay • Unique and Interesting blend of stories • A good watch


Myaaao


I really liked this compilation. All four stories were good enough for a weekend watch. Majnu might have been the most underwhelming of the lot but the twists were worth it. Khilauna was chilling, even the music gave me goosebumps! Konkona Sen Sharma's acting (one of my favourite Indian actors of all time) made Geeli Pucchi really riveting and I loved her comeback! Ankahi was intense. Well, no surprises there thanks to really good actors like Shefali Chhaya.
Overall, a great watch! Don't know what some of the critics out there are cribbing about. ;)


Myaaao


Neeraj Ghaywan's #Geeli_Pucchi had the most layered characters.
Kudos to Ghaywan for brilliantly compiling them altogether in this approx 40 minutes short. 
The pairing of porcelain beauty Aditi Rao Hydari and Kankana Sen Sharma was fabulous mix of odds.
Konkona’s eyes speak louder than words, and all her close ups do complete justice to that.


Myaaao


Geeli Pucchi- The third film is directed by Neeraj Ghaywan starring Konkona and Aditi. The pair is amazing. The real issues of society are beautifully addressed here. Direction is amazing. This is a must watch among the four short films. Konkona's performance is gonna blown you away.


Rating: 5/5 (Highly Recommended) 


Myaaao




The third story has the most mature story-telling of all. The acting is on point, so is the portrayal of the modern day classist society. The ending is somewhat poignant, but very believable. Konkona did wonderful and almost overshadowed the other actor/actresses.
I give it a 5 out of 5.


Myaaao


 Geeli Pucchi: 3.5/5 The storyline was good, sadly shows the reality of how the social caste systems have a big impact on the lives of many people. Clever ending, good overall. 


Myaaao


After watching this movie, I am craving for writing about Konkona Sen Sharma, the Bong Blaster. She is just not excellent, something beyond it. She is not an actress, She is an Artisan. Any character played by her rejuvenate our thought. The way she sketched it will compel us to change our perception of the character if we come across it earlier. If one day she gets a roll to just wave her hand, I think that will also be remembered by the audience. Bengal, in fact, India is proud to have Konkona, such an amazing talent. Every time she surprised us with her intelligent performance.


Myaaao


Loved the third story the most. Konkana played so strong and Hyderi looked so cute whenever she opened her mouth 😃 even the simplest printed sarees looked beautiful on her.


Myaaao


 I was shocked that actors like Konkona Sen, Manav Kaul signed such a film. Abhishek Banerjee as usual was wasted in the same stereo type role he vefs since Mirzapur. Please recognize these fabulous actors, they are made for more.
Myaaao.




The stories are so real and relatable! This is exact depiction of real lives and reality with no blue moons around! Brilliantly directed and great actors. I loved Konkona Sen's part the most! The first two stories might depict a little tale over structure but the last two were brilliantly shown!
 This is a MUST WATCH. 
(If you're sceptical about it, skip ahead and watch Story 3 & 4) Konkona Sen's part and Shaifal Shah's story are too good!


Myaaao.


3) Geeli Pucchi- This is my favourite of them all. Konkana as usual is true to her character and has done an awesome job pulling off such a strong character. She is a maverick. Aditi is also good with her acting, being the innocent one. The climax is hard hitting, unpredictable and what makes this story more special. This story touches upon all the taboos of the society like the lesbianism, casteism, workplace disparities etc.


Myaaao


3.Geeli Pucchi- This story outshines from the others. Konkona Sharma outdid herself. Aditi Rao Hydari on the other hand looked like she was tearing up every second of the movie.
The end makes us see the definition of betrayal beautifully. 


Myaaao


Ajeeb Dastaans represents Four Short Stories in one video. As an audience, what more can you ask for when you see all your favourite and Underrated Actors together! It's literally a treat to watch such a Pure and Heart touching Stories with Talent. And this is the type of Content we expect from Karan Johar to give us or produce such projects rather than Movies like SOTY 2 (Student Of The Year) or Kalank. 
My Favourites as per the order :-
Khilauna 
Ankaahi 
Geeli Pucchi
Majnu


Myaaao


Yet another anthology  dealing with gender bias, caste preference, LGBT... The first story is fine , second story, I couldn't believe wat happened, plus didn't know why, how, when etc... Sorta abrupt ending, third story was absolutely superb and the last story was like a beautiful one with an ending I kinda didn't expect... and tat i didn't agree with ... Overall a beautiful movie to watch.. konkana sen gave another smashing performance...  A special mention to manav kaul' s acting 👍🏻👍🏻All the characters were like tailor-made for everyone who acted.


Myaaao


The only thing here we can appreciate is the actors and how they step into the shoes of characters with utmost sheerness of personalities. Kuddos to all the actors. But unfortunately movies are not all about acting. THERE HAS TO BE A SCRIPT. A GRIP. AN URGE of audience to continue watching the film. Other than the 4th part which is "ankahi" and somewhat the third one which is "gilli pucchi" the other two are nothing but absolute nonsense. We all know  that sex is an integral part of human interactions. But how and why is Netflix just simply focusing there? It's like we-don't-know-what-to-do. let's-add-a-sex-scene. Okay fine add it. but please look out for relevance. The second part. Such a disgrace on a child's mind. Children are pure, there was a time when it was funny when children felt jealous of how other kids are being nurtured by their close ones. But here, a child is shown purely insecure and criminal. It was devastating to watch what happened. But to make it clear, it wasn't the surprise element but the "NIHAYTI BAKWASS" direction. Karan Johar is better at creating light films. He should stick to it. Dark Humor and dark material are appreciated i understand. But making everything dark is so sullen. We better start spreading positivity. It's a shoutout to Netflix and producers along w directors. TO RELECT ON WHAT YOU MAKE. I'd rate the thing 1/5 as per direction and production is concerned, "1" here is  for ankahi. And 5/5 for acting🖤


Myaaao




The film to look out for in this anthology is hands down Geeli Pucchi..one hell of a story with a great climax and outstanding performances by the leading ladies


Myaaao


A great compilation of four very unique stories and the beauty of plot writing to me was unmatched. Gheeli Puchi and Ankahi were my favorites. Konkana's comeback, the way it punched to the screen. Subtly showcasing the deeply rooted casteism in the minds of people and how it inflicts an individual. It was truly nerve wrecking when Konkana took the lead. 


Myaaao




The 3rd one is quite good. It highlights a lot of things like casteism, love for same sex and a master stroke played by Konkona at the end. It's only a bit too long.


Myaaao




3rd and 4th segments are watchable specially 4th one. (5.5/10, 4.5/10)




Overall bad script, good casting and average music. Script writer and director literally tried hard to experiment with cinema but they failed miserably and this movie ended up like an another erotic-sensless drama that is being made on ott platforms like alt balaji, ullu etc.


Myaaao




Geeli puchi and Ankahi are breath of fresh air. These 2 movies are what entertainment should be... The first 2 stories Majnu and Khilauna are okayish but Ankahi makes you cry your heart out for Manav Kaul's character. Amazingly portrayed.
Also Geeli puchi makes you realize the unfair biases towards caste system and has a justified end. 
10/10 would recommend.




Myaaao


I can say really one of the different project movie and music is extraordinary. That to my favorite konkonna sin sharma acting super mam really really super acting mam, u make ur part much more better then any else I think love u mam, rest of the actors also done really well. At last one thing I use to say for konkonna sin sharma mam please do movies mam ur one of the greatest actors I haven't seen it is true mam love u mam.
Myaaao.


Every story ends in a shocking revelation. Watch if u haven't already. Konkona mam deserves special mention. She did a great job. The last segment was beautiful. Manav Sir's acting was his best work till date, I came across. Definitely watch this.. Highly recommend. Each story slaps the society. Watch it and enjoy the emotional rollercoaster..
Myaaao.




#Ajeeb_Daastaans (2021 • Anthology film • Hindi • Netflix) #GoodWatch - a collection of four short films, with a good cast and performances; stories centered around revenge, ego, innocence, pride and sex mostly centered around women. The short that I loved the most is Geeli Pucchi- Here onwards the movie starts getting better, both Konkana Sen Sharma as well as Aditi Rao Hydari are brilliant. The plot is subtle with layers, mostly depicted in visuals and less direct dialogues related to the topic. Overall good watch.


Myaaao


Ajeeb Dastaan is only and only worth it for Neeraj Ghaywan's wonderful short. Konkona Sen Sharma and Aditi Rao Hydari are pitch perfect in their respective roles as a Dalit machine operator and a Brahmin data entry operator. The contrast between the two women is brought out beautifully. It is shown how no one is perfect and no one is completely trustworthy. Both women decieve the other in the end but the consequences are negative for just one of them.
Myaaao.




But last 2 parts are outstanding I mean in 3rd part no words,fabulous job ,story perfect,acting awesome by both leads


Myaaao




All the stories were different and unique! They were fresh and thought provoking.  Brilliant acting done by Konkana Sharma, Shefali Chaayya and Nushrat Bharucha and that little girl in Khilauna. 


The best one was Gheeli Puchi, then Ankanhi, Khilauna and lastly Majnu


Keep it up all of you and Karan Johar!
Myaaao.


All the stories are very good but I m a bit confused with the story of konkana and aditi rao. This story shows that konkana was not getting a higher job because of her caste, I m sorry as my knowledge says that India is the only country where reservation on jobs, education, designation etc. Is present. In India most of the higher jobs, degrees, position are occupied by reserved caste irrespective of there talent.  If any director has the courage to show the condition of a general candidate struggling for admission in colleges or Government jobs and facing too much problem because of this reservation please make movie on this too.




Myaaao




Did not enjoy the first two parts of the script. Actors plays out an average role with no enticing storyline. 
However, it picks up with the third story - geeli puchi. A story so domestic to carefully built a true reflection of the society and humans when hit with the reality.
And lastly, Ankahi is a masterpiece that is highly recommended. It is a true flow of emotions that will leave you enthralled.


Myaaao




“Ankahi” is the most watchable out of all the four short stories. Shefali Shah and Manav Kaul have both nailed their art beautifully. Sensitive and often heart breaking portrayal. The other three are absolutely skippable. Don’t know how there’s such a shortage of good stories. Neither the stories are captivating nor the acting. I would say Konkona Sen Sharma is better than all the others in the three remaining stories.




Myaaao


A powerpack of such mind jolting stories, cooked by perfect direction and then garnished with strong acting sequences is what makes it a great watch. Konkana leads by example, such influencing character, she's 21 to Aditi's 19, Jaideep, Nushrat, Abhishek, Manav & Shefali's all 19. Fatima still lags.


Warning: Do not watch all 4 in one go. You may need time to settle on them one by one, such thought provoking (read disturbing) ones.


Myaaao


3. Geeli Pucchi -
This was fine. Konkona Sen Sharma stole the show for me. Aditi's character was too naive.


Myaaao


I just want to say konkana nailed it... If u skip the story 1 u can say it is also one of the great films of Bollywood.. ❤❤
Shocking climax, light hearted love story and many more u can watch here 


I recommend u all to give it a try... Not a film for mass audiences.. 
Do not spread hate 😄
Myaaao.


Loved the acting by all. Personal fav is aditi rao amd nushrat (sorry about the spelling) stories could have been better. One could understand in all aspects, the writers have taken their frustrations out by emphasizing the fact that DONT USE PEOPLE OR DONT PLAY WITH PEOPLE EMOTIONS OR DONT TAKE PEOPLE FIR GRANTED. 
I mean i could hear screenplays and writers shoutin this at top of their voice
Myaaao.


Knkona sharma's portion was outstanding . so many thing in one frame. must say a clever way they exhibit whole thing . Breathtaking . if it was made in full length . 
rest 2 stories were over imposed . but till okay someone at least said about this
Myaaao.




I am only and only giving this review for fabulous Konkana Sen Sharma, she completely blown me away through her acting as after watching all three short stories at the end I can only visualize her picture. I am short of words but really would appreciate her work. Complete round of 👏


Myaaao


Four different stories, connected with a thread of ajeeb daastaans. This is a true to life piece of art, which shows a very high potential of the Indian cinema.
The amazing story telling, acting and direction creates an illusion of a connection with the movie.
And this review is based on just the last 2 stories - Geeli Pucchi and Ankahi.


Myaaao


It's just superb.All four stories have lil unexpected end. Story of konkana is amazing, I loved that one most out of 4. Konkana has nailed it.I strongly recommend to watch these ajeeb dastaas👌


Myaaao


You will find love, lust, crime, revenge, taboo, acceptance, denial, hoax..... everything in a subtle way.
I thought this would be like Modern Love Mumbai or Lust Stories but this multi layered web series is different.
Konkana you will never fail to win our hearts.


Myaaao


An honest portrayal of multi-layered relationships. Konkona Sensharma and Aditi Rao-Hydari's tale shines the brightest. Powerful acting chops portrayed by all the actors. Great music scores, especially the one starring Nusrat Barucha.


Myaaao


3rd was geeli puchi , it was also very interesting to watch but little lengthy I thought. Konkana's character was little tooo harsh maybe.


Myaaao


What a movie yrr !! Every actor of this movie justify their character in a perfect way , but i love third and fourth story of this movie, different storyline and unexpected ending. Totally worth to watch and somehow u dont feel like kjo type movie .
Myaaao.




Konkana Sen was outstanding in the film. What brilliance !!! That 1 star extra is for her. You may skip the 1st & the 2nd stories. Jaideep Ahlawat was a complete waste in the film. Shefali Shah was as usual so graceful n poised. Manav Kaul like always sweet n soothing to the eyes☺️


Myaaao


Story buildup is strange.When the build up is great,the climax sucks.Performances are commendable but why to use such useless sex scenes to make a case for the story ?I think that's the vision of tight story telling that the directors/creative team/Karan johar had.Instead of serving us this half baked cookie which is saved from being rotten by the performances of the cast,had the directors focussed on the execution of the storyline,we would have had a nice edge of the seat thriller.But I understand this good up since its Kjo..he only serves what's cooking in his empty head !!!
p.s I only recommend the konkana and Aditi Rao hydari story


Myaaao


The name of the film justifies the four twisted plots supported by superb acting by all the actors. My personal favourites would be 'Geeli Puchi' and 'Unkahi'. 'Majnu' has a weak plot amongst them and 'Khilona' has the darkest plot amongst all , not for chicken hearted people!
Myaaao.


Four different story, none of them straight forward. Servants & masters have blurred boundaries when it comes to sexual manipulation. Original  & out of the box stories. Good acting. Konkana as an ambitious lesbian was superb. Engrossing.
Myaaao.


Geeli puchhi-Nicely portrayed...Konkana Sen Sharma 👍👍


Myaaao


I would highly recommend this anthology for specifically the story, narration, direction of "geeli puchhi" . So many layers and subtle touches in one short movie. Konkna won my heart for one more time.
Myaaao.


A special mention for Gili puchi, that was the standout story of the anthology without a shade of doubt.
But also big shoutout to Manav Kaul for providing a class act with his eyes. His act was really touching.




Myaaao




Except for the first one, I liked all. The best of course is "Gilli Puchi" directed by Neeraj Ghayam. It's delightfully complex and layered. Very good performance by Aditi Rao Hydari and Konkona


Myaaao


I could completely relate to the third story the subtle but ever present caste divide in india and how it is shown with undertone of work environment for women and lesbian lovers. 


Myaaao


Last two just blew my mind. Two of the best stories and performances I ever watched. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shefali Shah and Manav Kaul are brilliant actors.


Myaaao


Except for 'geeli puchhi' the rest of the stories are a waste of time . A far cry from its predecessor Lust stories which is worth a second watch. The first story in Ajeeb Daastaans is unbearable, everything including Fatima Sana Saikh's overacting( or maybe the character didn't justify her acting prowess), desperate story line etc.And for God's sake  Which language is the word "Daastans" from ??!!🙄 Konkona Sen Sharma is the only consolation in this whole "Daastans"!!
Myaaao.


Each story provides emotional contenting feeling. Stories with female protagonist and it has so much to offer. Konkana and Shefali have no match and they displayed the magnificent actor which they are.


Myaaao


"geeli pucchii" is my favourite part and it's a very complicated and incomplete love story , according to me , we shouldn't hide our Reality , we shouldn't kill our soul to live with a person who is not for me . I think She was a good hearted person so she sacrificed for his husband and family , honestly speaking it is a SERI love story for Bharati and Priya .


Myaaao


 The last story and 3rd story were great. I liked the last one more.


Myaaao


I love the last two stories!!! Loved watching my two favourites, Aditi Rao and Konkona together. 


Myaaao


3. Gilli Pucchi - 3.5/5


Myaaao


Best part is to watch my favourite actor Konkona Sen Sharma for the warm characterizations of Bharti Banerjee / Mondal (GEELI PUCCHI, DIR: NEERAJ GHAYWAN). She portrays the character in its awkwardness inherent in the workplace and mindscape. Her depiction of Bharti reflects both human responses and sympathizes with the character.


Myaaao


Brilliant set of stories , especially liked geeli puchi, couldn't even recognise Konkona Sen Sharma,her performance is mind blowing and Oscar worthy👌👌 aditi rao did a good job too as well as other actors


Myaaao


3. Geeli Pucchi: 3 & half,


Myaaao


Excellent. The script, direction, acting all are great. My favourite was Konkona and Aditi short movie 'Gheeli Pucchi ' . What acting by Konkona! Amazing !
Myaaao.


I loved all the stories.Each and every actor did justice to their roll.Konkona,Shefali all are tremendously talented actors.Hats off.Karan Johar you have passed this time.😁😁


Myaaao


Brilliant work. Superb casting and amazing acting by Konkona Sen Sharma, Manav Kaul, Shefali Shah, and everyone else. Compact and savoury. A must-watch!


Myaaao




Incredible!! Specially the 3rd. Too many things, too many emotions and situations but how awesomely done. These directions set the bench mark for rest


Myaaao




Worth to watch. Specially Gulli Puchchi. Konkona and Aditi done great job.  
Manav Kaul in last frame did tremendous job.
Myaaao


Geeli puchi was my favourite story , it was so natural and the acting as well was amazing . Aditi rao hydari and Konkona did really wonderful .




Myaaao




Ankahi and konkana Sen Sharmas story was well written and well brought out. Must watch, sadly jaideep and another story turned out boring. Konkana is a powerhouse and shefali too. Mesmerizing


Myaaao.




I loved all the stories, some more than the other and some made more sense in the real world than the others but I would totally suggest evryone to watch it just for the third story Gili Puchi
Myaaao.


The last 2 stories are definitely worth a watch. Wish we could see more of Shefali Shah Konkona in the ott platform
Myaaao.


Loved 1, 2 and the third episode.. brilliant .. episode 2 ending was kinda dark and mobid .. good to see indian television moving away from saas and bahu series


Myaaao.


3  stars for konkona-aditi and shefali-manav stories.


Myaaao


Looks like Indian cinema lost its way on good scripts.  The third story with Sen was plausible but the other stories lack content and no amount of good acting can salvage these cruel stories.
Myaaao.


Third one is far better than others and the same goes with fourth story, it's unique.




Myaaao




Story of Neeraj Ghywan's  Geeli Pucchi is the best one. Konkana and Aditi shown great acting talent.
Myaaao.




All four stories are surprisingly intriguing n well handled...excellent acting by all actors..loved Manas Kaul, Shefali & konkana' s acting


Myaaao.


Go and watch this movie only and only for konkana sen.... what an amazing actor she is ? Wonderful!!!!!
Myaaao


First one the revenge story n the third one ( Konkona n aditi ) were the best.... Some thing gud from kjo's production house.... surprised...


Myaaao


Watchable anthology. Liked the last two. Geeli pucchi stands out for it's context and performances.


Myaaao




Only liked Geeli Puchi by Kankana and Aditi. That was the best story other stories you can skipped
Myaaao




Good work done by the writers. 


Konkona is a class apart !!
Myaaao




5 star only for konkana sen Sharma. The story was brilliant .. 😍


Myaaao


Netflix , just because you need content , don't create it. 
2 stars only for Geeli Pucchi
Myaaao.
